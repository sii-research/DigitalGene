## üèõÔ∏è About DigitalGene

We present Digital Gene, a novel, universal object description protocal that facilitates learning of embodied systems in numerous aspects, including

- Fully-parameterized object representation
- Procedural generation of novel and diverse objects
- Automated object function analysis and manipulation manual
<!-- - Procedual generation of novel objects.  -->
<!-- - Automated annotation for various types of knowledge -->

## üöÄ Highlights

### Fully-parameterized Object Representation

Using a carefully designed digital gene annotation system with program templates, objects in the physical world can be converted to a fully-parameterized representation with minor effort.

<!-- ### Procedual Generation of Novel Objects -->
### Procedural Generation of Novel and Diverse Objects

By sampling parameters that adheres to physical constraints as well as common sense, countless new objects can be procedurally generated using templates.

<!-- ### Automated annotation for various types of knowledge -->
### Automated Object Function Analysis and Manipulation Manual

Digital gene also supports parameterized defintion of knowledge, including segmentation, 6D pose as well as affordances. In a comprehensive way, these knowledge lays the foundation of interpretable and controllable object manipulation.

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

While versatile, objects with annotation knowledge scales at a negligible cost with digital gene, with properly designed templates and knowledge. Both generation and annotation are achieved with a click of a button.
